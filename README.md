Download application, learning go by doing go ...

This is a learning project for me to learn GO. Not to be taken seriously ... unless I happen to do something usable ...

# Intent
An application that doas two types of downloads:
1. Specified files (through json config files) and creates a checksum file stored paralell.
2. PIP libs (according to a requirements file) recursivly, i.e. it will get each packages dependency.
